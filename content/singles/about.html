<h1>Ratings</h1>
<p>We have baseball ratings for NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III from 2012-present and for NAIA from 2018-present though only 2022 ratings are currently loaded on the site. Score data is obtained from <a href="http://ncaa.com" class="uri">http://ncaa.com</a> and from <a href="http://masseyratings.com" class="uri">http://masseyratings.com</a>. Current season scores are gathered from both sources and discrepancies are reconciled, often by viewing individual team schedules to confirm score, site, and/or date. Game data used in the ratings are score and site of each contest with only same-division games included. The following factors were tested in each division over all past seasons to find the best predictive combination:</p>
<ul>
<li>How deep into the season to keep preseason rating (currently previous year-end figure) as part of the formula
<ul>
<li>Testing ranged from 0 to 60 games</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Include full margin of victory or institute cap
<ul>
<li>Testing included no cap and range of 1 to 20</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Value of home field advantage
<ul>
<li>Tested ranged from 0 to 1 runs at 4 decimal places</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Should preseason rating be only previous yearâ€™s figure or include data from earlier seasons
<ul>
<li>Multiple linear regression was used to find the best combination of prior year(s) and tested against preseason rating</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Current year ratings are determined by using the best combination of factors from the list above, which varies by division.</p>

<ul>
<li>SOS (Strength of Schedule)
<ul>
<li>The value for our SOS is based on the expected winning percentage of an average team against that schedule</li>
<li>A lower value means a tougher schedule and vice versa</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SOR (Strength of Record)
<ul>
<li>This is a plus or minus value showing how the team has fared against their schedule vs the expected record of an average team</li>
<li>A positive value means the team won more often than an average team would have and vice versa</li>
<li>This levels the SOS and illustrates which teams have performed best against their schedule regardless of difficulty</li>
</ul></li>
