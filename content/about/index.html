<h1>Ratings</h1>
<p>We have baseball ratings for NCAA Division I, Division II, and Division III from 2012-present and for NAIA from 2018-present. Score data was obtained from <a href="http://ncaa.com" class="uri">http://ncaa.com</a> and from <a href="http://masseyratings.com" class="uri">http://masseyratings.com</a>. Initial ratings are derived by using the score and site of each contest with only same-division games considered. The following adjustments were made and tested within each division to find the combination with the best predictive ability over the past nine seasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>How long to combine preseason rating with current season rating
<ul>
<li>From 0 to 60 games</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whether to cap margin of victory
<ul>
<li>Ranging from cap of 1 to no cap</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Value of home field advantage
<ul>
<li>Ranging from 0 to 1 runs to 4 decimal places</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Whether to include ratings from 2-5 seasons prior in preseason rating
<ul>
<li>Multiple linear regression was used to find the best combination of prior year(s) and then tested</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>SOS (Strength of Schedule)
<ul>
<li>The value for our SOS is based on the expected winning percentage of an average team against that schedule</li>
<li>A lower value means a tougher schedule and vice versa</li>
</ul></li>
<li>SOR (Strength of Record)
<ul>
<li>This is a plus or minus value showing how the team has fared against their schedule vs the expected record of an average team</li>
<li>A positive value means the team won more often than an average team would have and vice versa</li>
<li>This levels the SOS and illustrates which teams have performed best against their schedule regardless of difficulty</li>
</ul></li>
